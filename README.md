##  Towards Perceptual Loss:  Using a Neural Network Codec Approximation as a Custom Loss Metric

We train a neural network to approximate a low bit-rate codec and suggest the use of this network as a custom loss function.  We demonstrate perceptual improvement in reconstruction quality in a secondary, autoencoding task.
